# TIL (Today I Learned) Android App
This is the full code for the TIL Android App. 
The app connects to Reddit's www.reddit.com API using OAuth https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2,
and scans the first 25 pages of the TIL (Today I Learend) subreddit www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned. 
The App then picks one reddit post randomly and present the title on the screen.
